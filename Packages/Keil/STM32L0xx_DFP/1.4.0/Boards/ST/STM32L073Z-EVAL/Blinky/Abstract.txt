The 'Blinky' project is a simple CMSIS RTOS Kernel based example for
ST 'STM32L073VC' microcontroller using ST 'STM32L073Z-EVAL' Evaluation Board.
Compliant to Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS).

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    = HSI     = 16.00 MHz
   - SYSCLK  =           32.00 MHz

 - 4 LED blink.
 - blinking is paused while holding down the Tamper button.


The Blinky example is available in different targets:

  STM32L073 RAM:      configured for on-chip RAM
                      (used for target debugging)
					  
  STM32L073 Flash:    configured for on-chip Flash
                      (used for production or target debugging)
